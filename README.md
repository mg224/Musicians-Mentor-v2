# Musician's Mentor

Musician's Mentor is a full-stack platform that facilitates the connecting of young student musicians to experienced student musicians to find affordable music lessons and mentorship. The private teaching landscape in music, particularly at the high school level, has gotten increasingly expensive and inaccesbile to many. Musician's Mentor bridges this gap by managing an exclusive database of student teachers from top programs across the nation. Students can sign up for an account and browse the directory of teachers to find one who matches their current needs.
